### 初始化调用

```java
public final class RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor implements Interceptor {

  ...

  @Override public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {

    ...

    // 初始化数据流分配器
    StreamAllocation streamAllocation = new StreamAllocation(client.connectionPool(),createAddress(request.url()), call, eventListener, callStackTrace);
```

`StreamAllocation`是在`RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor`拦截时进行初始化的，传递了client的连接池，url，call，和eventListener。

### 源码

```java
public final class StreamAllocation {

  // 地址
  public final Address address;
  private RouteSelector.Selection routeSelection;
  private Route route;
  private final ConnectionPool connectionPool;
  public final Call call;
  public final EventListener eventListener;
  private final Object callStackTrace;

  // State guarded by connectionPool.
  private final RouteSelector routeSelector;
  private int refusedStreamCount;
  private RealConnection connection;
  private boolean reportedAcquired;
  private boolean released;
  private boolean canceled;
  private HttpCodec codec;

      EventListener eventListener, Object callStackTrace) {

    this.call = call;
    this.eventListener = eventListener;
    this.routeSelector = new RouteSelector(address, routeDatabase(), call, eventListener);
